# really-verbose
Solves and prints the cache to the console the classic dynamic programming coin change problem (min coin and max combinations).

- Verify your solution and trace logic through printed cache.
- Solves two variations of this problem: 
    - Minimum number of coins to make a certain target value (*solveMaxCombinations()*)
    - Maximum number of combinations of coin values to make a certain target value (*solveMinCoins()*)
- Kept in one class for copy + paste convenience.
- Edit variables VALUE and COIN_VALUES at the top of the class, then run the program to have both coin change variants solved.

*Known Bugs:*
- [ ] Minimum coin method *solveMinCoins()* doesn't work if there is no 1-value coin (03 JUL 2017)
